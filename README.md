### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process

Firstly, I ensured that my html code was solid, and arranged in my preferred format. I then began working on my external css file. When doing this I worked on the mobile site first – ensuring that all elements responded correctly in their active states. I make sure to implement all basic css first so that the core of the site is strong before testing/adding in more complex properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to put the transition property into practice. This is the first time that I have used the hover function outside of a button also – any feedback would be greatly appreciated! 


### Continued development

I would like to continue to develop my transition skills in my future projects.
